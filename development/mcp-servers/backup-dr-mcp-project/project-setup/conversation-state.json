      "content": "This MCP needs to protect critical workspace data that exists outside git version control. Primary targets include:\n\n**Critical Data Sources:**\n1. External brain storage (~workspace-brain/) - telemetry events, analytics, learning patterns, cache, patterns\n2. MCP-generated state - checklist-registry.json, workflow state files, agent assignments\n3. Configuration files - ~/.claude.json (MCP registrations), .smart-file-organizer-rules.json, environment configs\n4. Project artifacts - .ai-planning/ state files, temp/ workflows, .security-scans/, .security-issues-log/\n\n**Backup Strategy Requirements:**\n- Automated daily backups (cron/scheduled task integration)\n- Incremental backups for efficiency (only changed files)\n- Full backups weekly for baseline\n- Retention policy: 7 daily, 4 weekly, 12 monthly\n- Compression (gzip) for storage efficiency\n- Integrity verification (checksums/hashes)\n\n**Recovery Requirements:**\n- Point-in-time recovery (restore to specific date/time)\n- Selective restore (individual files or entire datasets)\n- Dry-run preview before restore\n- Automatic backup before destructive operations (like MCP uninstall)\n- Recovery validation (verify restored data integrity)\n\n**Integration Points:**\n- workspace-brain-mcp (backup telemetry and analytics data)\n- checklist-manager-mcp (backup registry and progress)\n- configuration-manager-mcp (backup configs and secrets metadata, not actual secrets)\n- All workflow MCPs (backup state files)\n\n**Constraints:**\n- No PHI in backups (verify data classification before backup)\n- Fast operation (<30 seconds for incremental backup)\n- Minimal storage footprint (aggressive compression)\n- Platform-agnostic (macOS, Linux, Windows support)\n- No external dependencies (use Node.js built-ins where possible)",

This data represents 7+ months of accumulated workspace knowledge and automation patterns.\n\n**Specific Risk Scenarios:**\n1. **Accidental deletion** - User accidentally deletes workspace-brain directory (~/.workspace-brain/) losing all telemetry and learning patterns\n2. **Corrupted state** - MCP state file corruption (checklist-registry.json, workflow state) breaks functionality\n3. **Failed experiments** - Testing new MCP features corrupts production data with no rollback option\n4. **System failures** - Disk failure, OS reinstall, hardware replacement loses all MCP-generated data\n5. **Configuration loss** - Accidentally unregister MCP or overwrite ~/.claude.json losing all MCP configurations\n\n**Current Gap:**\n- Git only protects source code and documentation\n- No automated backup for MCP runtime data\n- Manual backup is tedious and forgotten\n- No point-in-time recovery capability\n- No validation that backups are restorable\n\n**Impact of Data Loss:**\n- Lose 7 months of workspace telemetry (10,000+ events)\n- Lose learned automation patterns (50+ patterns)\n- Lose checklist progress tracking (multiple projects)\n- Lose workflow execution history and metrics\n- Lose performance baselines and anomaly detection data\n- Have to reconfigure all 20 MCPs from scratch\n\n**Why Now:**\n- Just hit 71% completion (20/28 MCPs) - risk compounds with each deployment\n- External brain contains increasingly valuable data\n- Adding 2 more MCPs today (checklist-manager, performance-monitor) increases surface area\n- Need safety net before building remaining MCPs\n\n**Success = Peace of Mind:**\nSet-it-and-forget-it automated backups with proven recovery capability.",
