## Tasks

[九늏 1. Update README.md with bug fix summary and production-ready status 游릭 (2/10)
   - Notes: Updated README.md with production-ready status (v1.0.1), bug fix summary, testing results, and version history
   - Verification: passed
[九늏 2. Update workspace SYSTEM-ARCHITECTURE.md with parallelization MCP details 游릭 (2/10)
   - Notes: Added comprehensive parallelization-mcp-server section to SYSTEM-ARCHITECTURE.md with all 6 tools, integration patterns, production readiness status, and capabilities documented
   - Verification: passed
[九늏 3. Create integration examples documentation with 4 example scenarios 游리 (3/10)
   - Notes: Created comprehensive integration-examples.md with 4 detailed examples (task-executor integration, dependency-aware execution, conflict detection, batch optimization strategies), plus advanced workflow example, best practices, and troubleshooting guide
   - Verification: passed
[九늏 4. Test execute_parallel_workflow tool (if multi-agent infrastructure available) 游릭 (2/10)
   - Notes: Tested execute_parallel_workflow with simulated execution - all 3 tests passed (basic execution, strategy comparison, constraints handling). Created comprehensive testing documentation and infrastructure requirements. Tool is production-ready for simulated mode; actual sub-agent spawning requires Claude Code infrastructure. Documented complete integration plan and 7-phase testing strategy for when infrastructure becomes available.
   - Verification: passed
