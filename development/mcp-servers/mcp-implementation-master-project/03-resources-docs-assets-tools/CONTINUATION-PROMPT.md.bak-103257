**CONTINUATION PROMPT - DUAL-ENVIRONMENT RETROFIT PROJECT**

I'm continuing the MCP Implementation Master Project dual-environment retrofit. Here's the current status:

**Project**: MCP Implementation Master Project
**Location**: `/Users/mmaruthurnew/Desktop/medical-practice-workspace/mcp-server-development/mcp-implementation-master-project/`

**Progress Summary:**
- Phase 1 (Enforcement): ✅ COMPLETE - Created validation script, updated documentation
- Phase 2 (Critical MCPs): ✅ COMPLETE - Retrofitted 5 MCPs with workflow-orchestrator dependencies
- Phase 3 (Stable MCPs): ✅ COMPLETE - Batch retrofitted 7 remaining MCPs
- Currently on: **Task 20 of 24** - Comprehensive validation of all 13+ MCPs

**What's Been Done:**

1. Created `validate-dual-environment.sh` validation script
2. Updated ROLLOUT-CHECKLIST.md with dual-environment compliance section
3. Updated MCP-BUILD-INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md with dual-environment pattern documentation
4. Created batch-retrofit-staging.sh for automated Phase 3 retrofits

**Staging Projects Created (12 total):**

Phase 2 (Critical - with workflow-orchestrator dependency):
- security-compliance-mcp-project ✅
- workflow-orchestrator-mcp-server-project ✅
- project-management-mcp-server-project ✅
- spec-driven-mcp-server-project ✅
- task-executor-mcp-server-project ✅

Phase 3 (Stable - batch retrofitted):
- git-assistant-mcp-server-project ✅
- smart-file-organizer-mcp-server-project ✅
- mcp-config-manager-project ✅
- communications-mcp-server-project ✅
- learning-optimizer-mcp-server-project ✅
- arc-decision-mcp-server-project ✅
- project-index-generator-mcp-server-project ✅

Already Compliant:
- testing-validation-mcp-project ✅

**Current Task (Task 20):**
Run comprehensive validation on ALL 13+ MCPs to confirm 100% compliance. I just validated testing-validation-mcp (PASSED).

**Remaining Tasks:**
- Task 20: Validate all 13 MCPs (IN PROGRESS - 1/13 complete)
- Task 21: Update MCP-COMPLETION-TRACKER.md with staging project status
- Task 22: Update NEXT-STEPS.md in master project
- Task 23: Test production feedback loop with one MCP
- Task 24: Document completion in EVENT-LOG.md

**Next Steps:**
Please continue Task 20 by validating the remaining 12 MCPs. Run the validation script for each:

Phase 2 MCPs (5):
1. security-compliance-mcp
2. workflow-orchestrator-mcp-server
3. project-management-mcp-server
4. spec-driven-mcp-server
5. task-executor-mcp-server

Phase 3 MCPs (7):
6. git-assistant-mcp-server
7. smart-file-organizer-mcp-server
8. mcp-config-manager
9. communications-mcp-server
10. learning-optimizer-mcp-server
11. arc-decision-mcp-server
12. project-index-generator-mcp-server

**Key Files:**
- Validation script: `./mcp-server-development/mcp-implementation-master-project/03-resources-docs-assets-tools/validate-dual-environment.sh`
- Batch script: `./mcp-server-development/mcp-implementation-master-project/03-resources-docs-assets-tools/batch-retrofit-staging.sh`
- MCP roles: `./mcp-server-development/mcp-implementation-master-project/01-planning/MCP-ROLES-DUAL-ENVIRONMENT-RETROFIT.md`

**Important Context:**
- All staging projects have been created and build successfully
- All package.json files for workflow-orchestrator dependents have been corrected
- Production remains unchanged and stable
- This is the first time coordinating all these MCPs together

Please continue from where we left off - validating the remaining 12 MCPs.
