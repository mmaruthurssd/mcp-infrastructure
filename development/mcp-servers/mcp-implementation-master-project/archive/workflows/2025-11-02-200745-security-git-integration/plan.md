# Workflow: security-git-integration

**Created**: 2025-11-02
**Status**: active
**Progress**: 100% (7/7 tasks)
**Location**: `temp/workflows/security-git-integration`

## Constraints

- Must not break existing git workflow
- Must be fast (<5 seconds for typical commits)
- Must provide clear error messages when blocking

## Tasks

[九늏 1. Review existing git-assistant integration patterns 游리 (4/10)
   - Estimated: 0.15 hours
   - Notes: Found two pre-commit implementations: bash version (simple patterns) currently installed in .git/hooks/, TypeScript version (full MCP integration) in security-compliance-mcp. Hook already active since Oct 31.
   - Verification: passed
[九늏 2. Design pre-commit hook that calls security-compliance-mcp 游리 (3/10)
   - Estimated: 0.3 hours
   - Notes: Design analysis complete: Current bash hook (pattern-based) is fast and working. TypeScript version (full MCP integration) exists but requires Node.js runtime. Decision: Keep current implementation for speed (<1s), document upgrade path to TypeScript version for advanced features.
   - Verification: passed
[九늏 3. Create pre-commit hook script with credential and PHI scanning 游리 (3/10)
   - Estimated: 0.4 hours
   - Notes: Hook already exists and is fully operational! File already created on Oct 31, tested successfully with test file containing AWS key and PHI.
   - Verification: passed
[九늏 4. Test credential detection blocking on staged files 游리 (3/10)
   - Estimated: 0.2 hours
   - Notes: Successfully tested! Hook detected 2 credential violations (AWS key pattern), blocked commit, generated scan report, and logged to .security-issues-log/
   - Verification: passed
[九늏 5. Test PHI detection blocking on staged files 游리 (3/10)
   - Estimated: 0.2 hours
   - Notes: Successfully tested! Hook detected 1 PHI violation (SSN pattern: 123-45-6789), blocked commit with clear remediation steps
   - Verification: passed
[九늏 6. Create integration documentation and usage guide 游리 (4/10)
   - Estimated: 0.2 hours
   - Notes: Created comprehensive SECURITY-GIT-INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md (395 lines) covering architecture, usage, examples, troubleshooting, performance benchmarks, and future enhancements
   - Verification: passed
[九늏 7. Update WORKSPACE_GUIDE.md with security integration 游리 (4/10)
   - Estimated: 0.15 hours
   - Notes: Added Security Git Integration Guide to WORKSPACE_GUIDE.md Quick Lookup Table with [KEY] marker, updated maintenance log to 2025-11-01
   - Verification: passed
